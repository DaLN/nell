rs1801133	T	0.25	Folate riboflavin	Folate is a water-soluble B vitamin that is necessary for  cell growth and development. Low blood levels of folate  have been associated with increased risk of heart disease  and stroke. Research has shown that the amount of folate  absorbed into the blood can differ between individuals  even when the same amount of folate is consumed. Some  people do not utilize dietary folate as efficiently as others  and are consequently at a greater risk of folate deficiency.  Studies have shown that an individual’s ability to process  dietary folate efficiently depends on a gene called MTHFR. Riboflavin may reduce homocysteine levels in the risk allele.	The MTHFR gene produces methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase  (MTHFR), which is a vital enzyme for folate usage in the body. MTHFR converts folate obtained from the diet to an active form of the nutrient that can be used by the body at the cellular level. Variations in the MTHFR gene determine the way individuals can utilize dietary folate.  Those people who have the CT or TT variant of the gene have reduced MTHFR enzyme activity and are at greater risk of folate deficiency when folate intake is low, compared to those with the CC variant.

rs5128	G C	0.2	Saturated fat	Apolipoprotein C-III is a vey low-density lipoprotein that can inhibit lipoprotein lipase, increasing cholesterol levels. The CC genotype is strongly associated with increases in LDL cholesterol when saturated fat intake is high. The GC genotype is moderately associated with increases in LDL cholesterol when saturated fat intake is high. GG is not associated with an increase in LDL cholesterol.  	This gene encodes a protein component of triglyceride (TG)-rich lipoproteins (TRLs) including very low density lipoproteins (VLDL), high density lipoproteins (HDL) and chylomicrons. The encoded protein plays a role in role in the metabolism of these TRLs through multiple modes. This protein has been shown to promote the secretion of VLDL1, inhibit lipoprotein lipase enzyme activity, and delay catabolism of TRL remnants. Mutations in this gene are associated with low plasma triglyceride levels and reduced risk of ischemic cardiovascular disease, and hyperalphalipoproteinemia, which is characterized by elevated levels of high density lipoprotein (HDL) and HDL cholesterol in human patients. This gene and other related genes comprise an apolipoprotein gene cluster on chromosome 11.	CVD
rs2472300	GA, AA	0.36	Caffeine	Caffeine is the most widely consumed stimulant in  the world and coffee is the most significant source of  caffeine. Research has shown that caffeine can influence  cardiovascular health. However, the reported effects  of coffee on the cardiovascular system have been  inconsistent and at times have appeared contradictory.  Some studies reported a link between high coffee  consumption and an elevated risk of high blood pressure  and heart disease, while other studies have shown no  effect or even a protective effect with moderate intake.  Two landmark studies* have now shown that the effect of  coffee on cardiovascular disease depends on a variation in  a gene called CYP1A2	The CYP1A2 gene produces an enzyme called cytochrome P450 1A2  (CYP1A2), which is the main enzyme responsible for breaking down  caffeine in the body. Variations in the CYP1A2 gene affect the rate  at which caffeine is broken down, which determines the impact of  caffeine on heart health. Individuals who possess the GA or AA variant  of CYP1A2 break down caffeine more slowly and are at greater risk of  high blood pressure and heart attack when caffeine intake is high. Those  who have the GG variant actually have a lower risk of heart disease with  moderate coffee consumption than those who consume no coffee at all. 	CVD
rs1801282	C G	1	Fat/med diet	Med diet: The Mediterranean diet varies by country and region, so it has a range of definitions. But in general, it's high in vegetables, fruits, legumes, nuts, beans, cereals, grains, fish, and unsaturated fats such as olive oil. It usually includes a low intake of meat and dairy foods.	PPAR-gamma is activated by omega-6 polyunsaturated fatty acids and regulates adipocyte differentiation. More specifically, PPARG is a nuclear transcription factor that involved in our natural circadian rhythm, regulating genes involved in storing fat and insulin sensitivity over a 24-hour cycle	CVD
rs174547	C T (C is the compromising allele)	0.3	Omega 3 and omega 6 fatty acids	it has been observed that certain variants of the FADS gene cause carriers to have decreased omega-6 and omega-3 levels. C allele signifies a lower activity than the T allele, requiring higher levels of omega 3 and omega 6. Because omega 6 dominate intake, the advice should be focused on omega 3 intake. 	FADS genes are associated with the function of desaturases that are essential for metabolism of omega 3 and omega 6 fatty acids.	CVD
rs4343	C T (C is the compromising allele)	0.35	Sodium	Sodium is an essential micronutrient that regulates blood  pressure and blood volume. Most people consume more  sodium than the body requires. The major adverse effect  of excess sodium intake is elevated blood pressure, which  predisposes to hypertension and heart disease. However,  some individuals do not experience as great an increase  in blood pressure in response to excess sodium intake as  others. Research* now shows that the effect of sodium  intake on blood pressure is influenced by variations in a  gene called ACE. 	The ACE gene directs the body to produce the angiotensin-converting  enzyme (ACE), which is known to play a role in regulating the response  of blood pressure to sodium intake. It is now known that a person’s  specific blood pressure response to excess sodium intake is dependent  on which variant of the ACE gene they possess. Those who have the  GA or AA variant of the ACE gene are at a greater risk of experiencing  elevated blood pressure when higher amounts of sodium are consumed  than those possessing the GG variant of the gene	CVD / Hypertension
rs6731545   A G	0.33	Sodium 		This gene encodes a member of the sodium bicarbonate cotransporter (NBC) family, part of the bicarbonate transporter superfamily. Sodium bicarbonate cotransporters are involved in intracellular pH regulation and electroneural or electrogenic sodium bicarbonate transport. This protein is thought to be an integral membrane protein.	CVD/Hypertension
rs5082	CC	0.24	Saturated fat	Saturated fats, such as those found in red meat and baked  goods have long been associated with health conditions  such as diabetes, cardiovascular disease and obesity.  However, the connection between saturated fats and  obesity, has been poorly understood. In the past, scientists  could not explain why certain people seemed prone to  obesity when consuming a diet high in saturated fats, but  others were less susceptible. A number of studies* have  now shown that the effect of saturated fat on obesity can  be influenced by variations in a gene called APOA2. 	The APOA2 gene directs the body to produce a specific protein called  apolipoprotein A-II, which plays an important role in the body’s ability  to utilize different kinds of fat. Scientists now understand that there are  different variations in the APOA2 gene present in the human population  and that these different versions of the gene interact with saturated  fat in unique ways to influence energy balance and ultimately the risk  of obesity. Those people who have the CC variant of the gene are  at a higher risk of developing obesity when consuming a diet high in  saturated fats than those possessing the TT or TC variant of the gene. 	CVD
rs9939609	AA	0.34	Energy	Physical activity has important benefits for mental health, physical fitness, weight maintenance and the prevention of many chronic illnesses. Cardiovascular conditioning exercises include those that elevate your heart rate for a sustained period of time such as brisk walking, running, swimming and cycling, and improve the function of your heart, lungs and blood vessels. Skeletal muscle conditioning exercises include activities such as weight lifting or certain types of yoga, which improve muscle strength and power and improve bone health. Most forms of physical activity are beneficial, however, different baseline levels of physical activity, depending on variation in the FTO gene, are needed to achieve/maintain a healthy body weight. Some individuals can achieve greater weight loss than others based on the amount and type of physical activity they perform. Research shows that variants in the FTO gene can impact your metabolic response to physical activity*.  Physical activity can reduce the effects of the FTO gene on risk of overweight and obesity by as much as 75%**	The FTO gene is also known as the ‘fat mass and obesity-associated gene’  since it can impact weight management and body composition. This gene’s  role in the body is related to metabolic rate, energy expenditure and energy  balance. It is also expressed in regions of the brain that are involved in the  regulation of energy intake. In individuals who have undergone bariatric  surgery for weight loss, variation in the FTO gene can help predict their long- term weight loss success, which can have significant implications for nutrition  care plans*. Current research shows that specific dietary and physical  activity recommendations can substantially help with weight loss and weight  maintenance in individuals with certain variants of the FTO gene. 	Obesity
rs4988235	CC,CT	0.16	Lactose	Lactose is a naturally occurring sugar found in dairy  products. When lactose is properly digested, it is broken  down into two different sugar molecules, glucose and  galactose. Lactase is the enzyme needed to break down  lactose. Some people do not produce any, or enough  lactase. Because of this, lactose passes through the  intestines undigested. When this occurs, gut bacteria in  the intestines ferment the lactose, which produces gas  that leads to bloating and cramps, and causes water to  enter the intestine quickly leading to diarrhea. These are  the uncomfortable symptoms associated with lactose  intolerance. Some people with lactose intolerance cannot  tolerate any milk products while others can tolerate  small amounts of lactose. When dairy is consumed with  a meal there can be minor symptoms or no symptoms  at all, but consuming dairy on its own (especially fluid  milk) can cause more severe symptoms.  Individuals with  an elevated risk variant are at an increased risk for low  calcium intake and blood calcium levels*.  	MCM6 is part of the MCM complex that helps to regulate the  expression of the LCT gene, which encodes lactase – the enzyme,  which plays a role in breaking down lactose. Variations in this gene can  impact your ability to break down lactose, therefore, impacting your  risk for lactose intolerance. Individuals who possess the CT variant may  produce some lactase but the amount of lactase produced is limited	Gastrointestinal health
rs1761667	GG, GA	0.4	Fat	Food intake is largely determined by our taste  perceptions and preferences for certain foods  and beverages. The way that we perceive the  taste of fatty foods is particularly important  because our intake of fats can affect heart health  and body composition. Fat is needed to absorb  certain vitamins including vitamins A, D, E, and  K. It provides 9 calories per gram, which is more  than double the calories in a gram of protein or  carbohydrate. Research shows that our preference  for fatty foods can vary depending on which version  of the CD36 gene we have*	The cluster of differentiation 36 (CD36) gene is also known  as fatty acid translocase. It is found on the surfaces of many  cells and is involved in the transport of fat from the blood.  Several studies have now linked variations in the CD36 gene to  differences in the perception of the taste and texture of fats and  oils. ‘Super tasters’ tend to be able to detect the taste of fats  and oils at lower levels than ‘low tasters.	Obesity, CVD
rs17782313	CC, CT	0.25	Energy	Eating between meals (i.e. snacking) can be beneficial  if snacks are healthful and the extra calories are not in  excess of those needed to maintain a healthy weight.  Healthy snacks can assist with regulating blood sugar  levels and weight control, curb food cravings and boost  energy levels. However, for many people snacking is  often an unhealthy habit due to snack-food choices and/ or excessive calorie intake beyond one’s needs. For your  overall health and wellness, it is important to manage  emotional eating (psychological reasons for snacking),  and focus on more healthful snacking when you feel  hungry. Some reasons for emotional eating may include  boredom, habit (i.e. eating in front of the television, or at  certain times), stress, frustration, anxiety or loneliness.  Scientists have also now discovered that variations in the  MC4R gene are associated with the likelihood of eating  between meals driven by the desire to eat more or less  frequently depending on your genotype*	The MC4R gene codes for the melanocortin 4 receptor, which is found  in the hypothalamus region of the brain. This is an area of the brain  that controls hunger and appetite. The MC4R gene plays an important  role in appetite regulation and hunger cues. Research shows that  individuals with the CC or CT version of the MC4R gene are more  likely to eat between meals often and have a heightened appetite. 	Obesity
rs4143094 	GT, TT	0.25	Meat		A significant interaction was observed between processed meat intake and rs4143094 (p-interaction:8.7 × 10−9). This SNP lies in the promoter region of GATA3, a gene which is involved in ulcerative colitis and which has been previously linked to colorectal cancer. Specifically, the association between processed meat and CRC was strongest among those with the rs4143094-TT genotype (OR:1.39), with a weaker association observed among those with one variant allele (TG OR:1.20) and no association among those with the GG genotype (OR:1.03)	Colorectal cancer
rs7579 	CT, TT	0.25	Selenium	Selenium helps the immune system work properly, as well as in reproduction. It also helps prevent damage to cells and tissues. Good sources of selenium include:  brazil nuts, fish,  meat,    eggs     0.075mg a day for men (19-64 years)     0.06mg a day for women (19-64 years) If you eat meat, fish or nuts, you should be able to get all the selenium you need from your daily diet.	This gene encodes a selenoprotein that is predominantly expressed in the liver and secreted into the plasma. This selenoprotein is unique in that it contains multiple selenocysteine (Sec) residues per polypeptide (10 in human), and accounts for most of the selenium in plasma. It has been implicated as an extracellular antioxidant	Cancer
rs1695	A G	0.35	Antioxidants 	Mostly refers to cruciferus vegetables	The glutathione S-transferases (GSTs) are a family of enzymes that play an important role in detoxification by catalysing with reduced glutathione the conjugation of many hydrophobic and electrophilic compounds. Based on their biochemical, immunological, and structural properties, the soluble GSTs are categorized into 4 main classes: alpha, mu, pi, and theta. The GSTP1 member of the GST family is a polymorphic gene encoding active, functionally different GSTP1 variant proteins, which are believed to function in xenobiotic metabolism, and play a role in susceptibility to cancer and other diseases.	Cancer
rs1050450	C T	0.28	Antioxidants 		Glutathione peroxidase 1 (GPX1) is a peroxidase enzyme, encoded for by the GPX1 gene which has a strong antioxidant activity. GPX1 is expressed in almost all tissue of the body as it plays a major role in protecting cells from oxidative stress. It’s major function is to detoxify hydrogen peroxide, produced by many reactions within a cell into water which can then be excreted. It can also detoxify lipid peroxides	Cancer
